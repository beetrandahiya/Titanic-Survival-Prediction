# linear__regression_titanic_data

This was my first step into machine learning, Its not new, I am just uploading it on Github now.<br>
Its a linear regression model which predicts, if a particular person would stay alive or would die on the RMS Titanic which sank in North Atlantic Ocean, based on the trend in training data.

# Linear Regression Algorithm 

Linear Regression is a very simple algorithm in which, we give in a dataset and the model try to figure out a <b> Line of Best Fit</b>. 
And finally create a linear trend (with a uniform slope) which can be used to efficiently coin out expected outcome from a same type of data.

Its a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm.

# RMS Titanic Disaster
<img src="https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp2608250.jpg"><br>
The RMS Titanic, a luxury steamship, sank in the early hours of April 15, 1912, off the coast of Newfoundland in the North Atlantic <br>after sideswiping an iceberg during its maiden voyage. <br> Of the 2,240 passengers and crew on board, more than 1,500 lost their lives in the disaster.<br> Titanic has inspired countless books, articles and films <br>(including the 1997 ‚ÄúTitanic‚Äù movie starring Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio),<br> and the ships story has entered the public consciousness<br> as a cautionary tale about the perils of human hubris.
